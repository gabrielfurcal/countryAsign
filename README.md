# countryAsign
This project is a test of knowledge where you have to create an application where you can asign to the people the country they belong.

# Strucute
This project is a MVC application with Laravel, a PHP framework and MySQL.

# Requeriments
You need to create a first CRUD where you can add a country. Every country that you create must be listed in a view table showing the name and the options to edit and delete it.

Next, you need to create another CRUD where you can add a person with a  name, last name, age, sex, email and select the country where belongs. Every person that you create must be listed in a view table where you can see her full name (name + last name), email and country, also with the option to edit and delete her. This table must have a search field where you can filter the table by the full name of the person. 

# Notes
The edit screen of every CRUD must let you edit the same fields than create screen.

You must upload a .sql file whit the DDL script.

Use Bootstrap for the UI.

# Good luck! :D
